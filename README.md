# Hello, World! 👋

### Technology • Empathy • Humility • Integrity • Love

I’m Billy Jo (he/they), an experienced software development leader and Eagle Scout with a lifelong passion for service. I believe in using technology to make the world a more just and equitable place for *all* humans, especially those who’re traditionally underserved by society at large. Causes benefiting kids are particularly close to my heart.
